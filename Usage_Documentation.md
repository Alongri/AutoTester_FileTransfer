# Usage Documentation

AutoTester FileTransfer offers two main options for file copying: "Copy from Local Branch" and "Copy from Remote Branch." Additionally, you can configure default settings in the "Option Tab."

## 1. Copy from Local Branch

In this option, you can copy various types of files between projects, whether they are within the same Git repository or across repositories. Here's how it works:

1. Select the type of file you want to copy.
2. Choose the source location from where you want to copy.
3. Specify the destination location to which you want to copy (please select the entire repository and not a specific path).
4. Enter the project name to which you want to copy. If you're copying a campaign, provide a new project name.

## 2. Copy from Remote Branch

In this option, you can connect to a Bitbucket server and select files from the list of all branches that exist in the master branch. The process is similar to "Copy from Local Branch" and includes the following steps:

1. Connect to the Bitbucket server.
2. Choose the branch from which you want to copy a campaign, test, or procedure.
3. Specify the destination location to which you want to copy the selected files.

## Option Tab

In the "Option Tab," you can configure default settings for your tool:

- **Default Path to Your Git Repo:** Set a default path for your Git repository to streamline the copying process.
- **Default Bitbucket HTTP Link:** Specify the default Bitbucket HTTP link for easy access to remote branches.
- **Default Repository for Files:** Choose the default repository for files that you copy from.

These settings can help you simplify the copying process by predefining certain values.

With these options, AutoTester FileTransfer provides flexibility and convenience in managing your testing files and projects. You can customize the tool to suit your specific workflow and requirements.
