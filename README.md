## Understanding Key Concepts

- **Campaign:**
    - A campaign is the highest-level organizational unit within your AutoTester project. It represents a comprehensive testing project that checks an entire area of LTE features.

- **Test:**
    - Tests are specific subsets or components of a campaign. Each test focuses on checking a particular feature or aspect of the overall project (campaign).

- **Procedure:**
    - Procedures are smaller, more granular components of your project. They can be part of a test or part of the campaign and are used to define and execute specific actions or steps required for testing.
